This article will explain how to create a SQL Server CLR function stored in a C# class library without creating a SQL Server database project. We will first briefly explain the concept of .NET common language runtime (CLR) and then build a C# class library using the .NET framework. Then, we will use the C# library to create user-defined CLR functions in SQL Server.
