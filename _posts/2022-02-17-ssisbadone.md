I have been working with SSIS for more than ten years and answering related questions on Stack Overflow for more than five years. During this period, I noted several bad practices that may affect the package performance used by SSIS users. I decided to start writing a series to explain those practicesâ€™ side effects and provide valuable resources. The series will be called "SSIS Bad Habits". Each of its articles will contain one or more bad practices depending on if I already wrote about those practices on a different blog or not.
