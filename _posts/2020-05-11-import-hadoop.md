In this article, we will briefly explain the Avro and ORC Big Data file formats. Then, we will be talking about Hadoop data flow task components and how to use them to import and export data into the Hadoop cluster. Then we will compare those Hadoop components with the Hadoop File System Task. Finally, we will conclude our work.
