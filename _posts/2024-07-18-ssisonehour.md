The goal of this tutorial is to enable ETL developers to obtain practical knowledge to exploit SSIS in transforming and combining data through hands-on exploration to be ready for real-world challenges in managing information.
We'll examine and discuss some of the most essential components and functionalities. We will begin by reviewing the Microsoft SSIS interface and ways to navigate it. We will then address connection managers and set up connections to various data sources. Also, we will explore what makes control flow tasks different from data flow tasks and how they fit into data workflows.
In this demonstration, we'll import a CSV file into SQL Server, including derived column creation, conditional splitting, and the need for data conversion. Immediately after, we'll look at variables and expressions in SSIS for dynamic data processing. Additionally, we will have another demonstration where multiple CSV files are looped over until they reach SQL Server to show how well it handles iterative copies of data via SSIS.
