Fortunately, Microsoft SQL Server provides several methods for performing these types of searches with T-SQL. This SQL tutorial illustrates some of the most common techniques for searching between two date values in SQL, including using the BETWEEN operator, the greater than (>) and less than (<) operators, and the DATEPART() function. It also provides some tips for efficiently searching between dates on partitioned and sharded tables, which can help improve performance.
