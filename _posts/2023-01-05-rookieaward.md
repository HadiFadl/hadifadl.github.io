Dear Audience, 2022 was my first year as an [contributing author for MSSQLTips.com](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlserverauthor/412/hadi-fadlallah/). I have written an article series (6 articles) named "SSIS Bad Habits" where I explained several bad practices that decrease the SSIS packages performance.
I am gload to annouce that I was recognized as a contender for the **Rookie of the Year** award. If you really like my writing or speaking, please take a moment to visit the website and [vote](https://www.mssqltips.com/mssqltips-author-of-year/) for me. 
This can be done every day until the end of the month.

Sincerely,

Hadi
