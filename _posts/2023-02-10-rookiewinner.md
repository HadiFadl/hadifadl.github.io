I am very thankful for being awarded the MSSQLTips.com Rookie of the year. I am pleased that this award was based on the [SSIS Bad Habits article series](/series) I published in 2022. A special thanks to Jeremy Kadlec, who encouraged me to complete this article series before the end of the year.

Noting that new MSSQLTips.com authors in 2022 that had at least 5 published tips are qualified for the Rookie of the year award. The winner is selected based on the community, peer and leadership voting.
