Since many students and developers cannot pay for the certifications exams fees, I created a #GitHub repository to list all free professional exams provided by tech companies even if it was offered on a specific occasion (ex: Microsoft Ignite Cloud Skills Challenge). I will be grateful for any contribution. And I hope that this will help someone to get a better opportunity.
