I just discovered that I’m listed as a contributor in two published books on Microsoft SQL Server:

1. [Learning Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.dbooks.org/learning-microsoft-sql-server-5605982413/)
2. [Microsoft SQL Server Notes for Professionals](https://www.dbooks.org/microsoft-sql-server-notes-for-professionals-1529/)

I was puzzled! How did this happen? Here’s the interesting backstory…

What’s interesting is that these books were generated from the Stack Overflow Documentation project; an experimental, community-driven documentation platform launched in 2016 and discontinued in 2017. 

When it was shut down, Stack Overflow released a full documentation dump allowing the content to be reused and compiled into resources like these books.

A nice reminder that community contributions can live on in unexpected ways... Even years later!
